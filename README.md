A collection of things I'm willing to share over my past OS development experiments. The early OS I've provided was pretty much a follow through of what James Malloy mentioned in his popular tutorial. My later works are withheld until I get to ring 3 in my new version. Also some things I am not comfortable sharing since I have some unique ideas!

Also, pardon the globals. I was more concerned with getting this off the ground, and understanding the gist of everything.
